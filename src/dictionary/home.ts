Both of us wanted to be friends but after spending some time together carpooling to dance events, we both found ourselves more aware of one another.

    'At the end of an unusual rainy season, we went to Samuel P. Taylor SP to take a break and enjoy the green mountains. We got to the peak of our hike, took a break to enjoy the view, and started to pack up to go down when Brandon asked me to take a picture near the edge. I walked to where he pointed and when I turned around to face him, I saw him starting to kneel down with a ring in his hand.  I sobbed for quite some time but finally said "YES" and we were engaged.',
